Electric vehicles (EVs) rely on batteries as the most important part of clean transportation. The electronic control system that monitors and manages the battery pack charge is called the battery management system "BMS". Modern electric vehicles require battery tracking because the cellular infrastructure is responsible for the well-being, functioning, or survival of the driver. Technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) offer great potential for the development and improvement of electric vehicles. EVs have recently been attracting attention due to their long cell life and low emissions. The limited capacity of the cell and the limited number of charging or battery charging options are the biggest problems facing electric vehicles today. This method makes it possible to build the required equipment and use BMS to accurately predict the remaining energy.
